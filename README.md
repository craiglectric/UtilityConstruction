Utility Construction - Live Project

Complete project located in UtilityConstructionProject.xd - use this file to view all projects on one artboard.

All the files in this repo were created by myself during a 2 week live project as part of The Tech Academy's UI/UX Bootcamp. The purpose of this project
was to expose students to a real life example of what the workplace will be like, such as working on a team, using repositories, working with a project that's already in progress, and working with other people's materials.

I was tasked with creating Adobe XD mockups using a given color palette, images, and icons for a company named Utility Construction. For this project I designed a home page with navigation bar that included a drop down menu that links to two other pages. I also created a landing page and two newsletter templates. I designed a desktop, tablet, and mobile version for each of these projects. I also prototyped the homepage so all links are functional.
